# Netflix Data Analysis using Dask
## Overview
This project performs Big Data Analytics on Netflix's dataset using Dask, a powerful parallel computing library for handling large datasets. The dataset includes information about Netflix movies and TV shows, such as title, genre, release year, country, and rating.

Using Dask, we demonstrate efficient data processing and analysis on this large dataset, showcasing scalability and performance improvements over traditional Pandas.
